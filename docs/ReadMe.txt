CAps v2.1.1 is built with privacy and consumer confidence in mind:

‚Ä¢ Local-only operation ‚Äî no network activity, no telemetry, no data collection
‚Ä¢ Digitally signed binaries (.sig) using RSA-4096 GPG keys
‚Ä¢ Included public key file (CAps_public.asc) for independent signature verification
‚Ä¢ SHA-256 hashes published for both EXEs to ensure file integrity
‚Ä¢ Fully offline, self-contained ‚Äî runs directly on your system without external dependencies
‚Ä¢ Executables run locally without installation


To verify integrity:

	1. SHA-256 hashes provided for both EXE files.
		CAps 2.1.1.exe: 91CB94D8CC10C404F20DEF0C840569BA7A1B22FB676094E8137C775CDBD4F6BE

To verify authenticity:

	1. Import the public key:
  	 	gpg --import CAps_public.asc

	2. Verify the signature:
  	 	gpg --verify CAps_v2.1.1.exe.sig CAps_v2.1.1.exe

	If valid, you‚Äôll see a message confirming a good signature from:
	
		Toshon Jennings, toshon.tech@gmail.com
	
		Public Key Fingerprint: 
		pub rsa 4096 2025-07-21 [SC] [expires: 2027-07-21]

FAQs

Q: Why does my antivirus or VirusTotal flag this EXE?
A: AutoHotkey scripts often trigger false positives due to clipboard automation. CAps v2.1.1 is fully offline, self-contained, and signed with a GPG key. All verification instructions are provided so you can confirm safety independently.

Q: Why does VirusTotal say ‚ÄúNot signed‚Äù?
A: CAps is signed with a GPG public key (CAps_public.asc), not a commercial Authenticode certificate. This protects open-source workflows without requiring centralized infrastructure.

Q: How can I verify the file hasn‚Äôt been tampered with?
A: Use the provided `.sig` files or compare SHA-256 hashes in README and `hashes_v2.1.1.txt`. Step-by-step commands are included above in this ReadMe.

Q: Can I use CAps on any Windows version?
A: Yes‚ÄîCAps is compiled with AutoHotkey v2 and runs on Windows 10 and 11 without external dependencies.

Q: Does CAps collect or transmit any data?
A: No. CAps runs locally, processes your clipboard, and exits silently. It doesn't send, save, or log anything externally.
