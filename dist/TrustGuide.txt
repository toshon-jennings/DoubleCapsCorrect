üîê TrustGuide.txt ‚Äì Verifying CAps v2.1.1

Thank you for downloading CAps v2.1.1. This guide shows how to confirm the integrity and authenticity of the EXE files included in this release.

INCLUDED TRUST ASSETS
| File | Description | 
| CAps 2.1.1.exe | User-friendly binary | 
| CAps_v2.1.1.exe | Automation-friendly binary | 
| CAps 2.1.1.exe.sig | Digital signature (signed with GPG) | 
| CAps_v2.1.1.exe.sig | Digital signature for automation EXE | 
| Verify_Hashes_2.1.1.txt | SHA-256 hashes for both EXEs | 

_____________________________

STEP 1: VERIFY THE SHA-256 HASH
	-Use PowerShell or Command Prompt:
		Get-FileHash "CAps 2.1.1.exe" -Algorithm SHA256
		Get-FileHash "CAps_v2.1.1.exe" -Algorithm SHA256
	-Compare the results against the hashes listed in Verify_Hashes.txt.

STEP 2: VERIFY THE DIGITAL SIGNATURE
	-Option A: Using Kleopatra
		- Import Toshon's public key (linked in README)
		- Right-click the .sig file ‚Üí ‚ÄúDecrypt / Verify‚Äù
		- Kleopatra should confirm: ‚ÄúSignature is valid and verified‚Äù
	-Option B: Using GPG CLI
		gpg --verify CAps 2.1.1.exe.sig CAps 2.1.1.exe
		gpg --verify CAps_v2.1.1.exe.sig CAps_v2.1.1.exe

You should see a Good signature message if verification succeeds.

_____________________________

WHAT THIS MEANS
- A matching hash confirms the file hasn‚Äôt been modified
- A valid signature proves the file came from Toshon and wasn‚Äôt tampered with
- Timestamping .ots files are bonus proof-of-existence‚Äîcoming soon

_____________________________

NOTE 
OpenTimestamp .ots files and verification support are expected beginning with an upcoming release.
